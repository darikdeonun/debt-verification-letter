# Debt Verification Letter
A [debt verification letter](https://credit.org/blogs/blog-posts/what-are-debt-validation-letters) is a formal written request from a debtor to a creditor or collection agency asking for detailed proof of the debt they claim is owed. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you have the right to request verification of a debt within 30 days of receiving a collection notice. This letter should include the creditorâ€™s name, the amount of the debt, and any relevant account information. It serves to ensure that the debt is valid and that you are not being pursued for a mistaken or fraudulent claim. The creditor or collection agency is required to provide this verification before taking further collection actions, giving you an opportunity to dispute any inaccuracies or negotiate terms if necessary.
